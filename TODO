* Template about package types, not name/version/location
* Use template for container instead of putting `vector`s everywhere
* Use template for location type
* Where applicable, use boost static visitor instead of the other.
* Change BOOST_REQUIRE so that it doesn't stop tests then and there if it's wrong
