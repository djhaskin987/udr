I strive to maintain an open and safe environment for
contribution. There are a lot of people out there with a lot of
opinions and philosophies.  Therefore, as a rule, any discussion, pull
request, feature request, bug report, or other contribution, made in
part or as a whole with the apparent purpose of talking about,
criticizing, or affecting anything but what the *code* should be and how
it should behave is at best off topic, and at worst offensive to
somebody. I will listen to complaints at
![this email](report-abuse.png). I reserve the right to
delete any comments or block PRs if those contributions are hurting someone's
feelings through blatant attack or insensitivity.

* Also:
  - Be nice.
  - When someone implements a feature or fixes a bug, please thank them.
  - When a bug or feature has not received attention in a long time, please be
    patient and forgiving.
  - When someone disagrees with you, that's okay.
  - Remember that we are all real people.
